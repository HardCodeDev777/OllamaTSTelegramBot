# OllamaTSTelegramBot

> [!NOTE]
> This is TypeScript version of my [OllamaTelegramBot](https://github.com/HardCodeDev777/OllamaTelegramBot/tree/main). Original was made in C#.

> [!NOTE}
> README below will be similiar as README in OllamaTelegramBot, because there is almost no difference between them in functionality.

A simple Telegram bot for communicating with LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Select one of two LLMs that you want to talk with(you can change them in the script).

It was made in an hour just for fun.

## 📚 Commands
Bot has only one command:
